# Cave-Organizer
Storage cave inventory system

Planning Stage:
    Definfe:
        - Requirements of project:
            - self hostable
            - open source
            - reactive design for mobile and desktop viewing
        - Bonus requirements
            - Multi-User support
            
        - Features:
            - a main homepage, allowing a user to view all avaliable containers (in my case, boxes)
            - on the main page the user should be able to add or remove containers (we always get new boxes, sometimes we combine, somtimes we destroy boxes)
            - the user should be able to click on a box, and go to a inventory list of what is inside the box, a table showing theitem name, item description and a thumbnail photo of the item
            - clicking on a item should provide the user to open the page for that item.  It should have a detailed view of that item, the user should be able to define the finer details of this item such as the make and model of the item, as well as a description (ie"USB A to B Cable: 6'").  The user should be able to check the item out, return the item if it is already checked out, or remove the item if the item will no longer reside in that container
